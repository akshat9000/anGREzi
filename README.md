## Description
This is a very simple implementation of a word of the day app. It spawns a random word, then if you dont know what it means, you have the option to get the meaning, or simply ask for a new word. I was bored and also wanted to improve my vocabulary for my GRE exams so I made this up, funny what you can do with time on your hands :P (Thanks for nothing lockdown!)

## Behind the scenes
Here, I've come up a very basic front-end implementation of a website using *HTML, CSS* and *Javascript,* and in the attached *Javascript* file, I've used *jQuery* and *Ajax* to call the free [Wordnik API](https://developer.wordnik.com/docs). Wordnik is a free to use dictionary which looks up the meaning of a word from multiple dictionary sources. To use this API, you need an *API key,* but for right now, I've used the standard key which is provided to all users, ofcourse with some limitations (meaning you cant continuously hit refresh for a new word for a long time), but anyone can apply for a new API key [here](https://developer.wordnik.com/).

## Amuse-Bouche
Github doesn't allow hosting of dynamic pages with server implementation, or atleast I dont know how, but to get a feel of the static implementation, head over to my page [anGREzi](https://akshat9000.github.io/). Since there is no server-side application here, the search bar wont work. Also, the API call may be a bit slow, so please be patient!
